# Utility Mining & Computing Lab

Established by Dr. Wensheng Gan, 2018

Dr. Vincent W. Gan is currently a visiting scholar at Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL, USA, under the supervision by Prof. Philip S. Yu (ACM fellow and IEEE fellow). He received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China, in 2016 and 2020, respectively. His research interests include data mining, utility mining, fuzzy theory, and big data technologies. He has published more than 50 research papers in referred journals (i.e., ACM TKDD, ACM TDS, ACM TMIS, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TCYB, INS, AEI, KAIS, etc.) and international conferences (i.e., BigData, DSAA, DEXA, SAC, SMC, etc.), which have received more than 700 citations, as of 2019/12/31. 

My current project is "UPM: utility-oriented pattern mining" and "Utility Computing in IoTs".
